~~This needs my own for-sgx-minimal-dependency dyninst (obsoleted)~~

~~The zip.sh and unzip.sh scripts are used for compress the static libs in the ./lib dir.~~

~~Before push, please remember do ./zip~~

~~To build the specified dyninst, a CMAKE config "-DENABLE_STATIC_LIBS=YES -DUSE_Open=OFF". But the DUSE_Open option seems not useful...~~

~~Currently I use the ./main from the ../nw dir for the target program, still need to know if it is suitable...~~
