# Privacy-preserving TEE protoype on a service-oriented environment

***

Although SGX can provide strong isolation and integrity assurance, code privacy may raise some concerns when using it in cloud environments.

So in this paper we are aiming at a new problem: how service providers build a Practical Privacy-preserving TEE that can ensure the privacy of both data providers and code providers, i.e., a solution that enables a user to verify whether a remote service (such as MLasS) has the properties of confidentiality (and integrity) without touching the binary/source code.

We also provide a compiling tool set which is applicable for the verification.
