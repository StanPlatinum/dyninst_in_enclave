To build the checker statically, you will need three static libraries

* Capstone

Capstone can be cloned at https://github.com/aquynh/capstone. Capstone by default will generate a static library (capstone.a). To reduce program size, you can configure Capstone to only build x86 instruction decoding support. 

```
git clone https://github.com/aquynh/capstone.git
cd capstone
mkdir build
mkdir install-x86
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PATH_TO_INSTALL_X86 -DCAPSTONE_ARCHITECTURE_DEFAULT=OFF -DCAPSTONE_X86_SUPPORT=1
make & make install
```

* libelf

We use the libelf from the elfutils (https://sourceware.org/elfutils/). By default it will generate a static library. 

* libz

libz.so is typically already installed in system directory. In case libz.a is not installed, it can be generated by compiling from source (https://zlib.net/).
